🩻 X-Ray Vision AI (Medicax)

Technical X-Ray Image Analysis with Metric-Driven RAG & Explainable AI

X-Ray Vision AI (Medicax) is an advanced medical imaging analysis platform designed to evaluate X-ray image quality, preprocessing pipelines, and structural visibility using classical computer vision, quantitative metrics, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

⚠️ Important:
This system does NOT perform medical diagnosis.
It provides technical, image-processing–level interpretation only, intended to support radiologists, researchers, and students in understanding image quality, enhancement effectiveness, noise behavior, and segmentation reliability.

✔ Pipeline comparison & explainability
✔ Noise & artifact analysis
✔ Segmentation reliability analysis
✔ Research, education, and technical validation

❌ Disease diagnosis
❌ Clinical decision making
❌ Pathology detection

🔁 Full Processing Workflow
1️⃣ Image Upload

User uploads X-ray image (PNG/JPG)

Sent to backend via REST API

2️⃣ Enhancement & Denoising

Multiple pipelines are executed automatically:

Enhancement Methods

CLAHE (8×8, 16×16)

Histogram Equalization

Noise Reduction

Gaussian Filter

Median Filter

Bilateral Filter

Each combination is evaluated independently.

Otsu Thresholding (bone separation)

Watershed Segmentation (region separation)

Region statistics extracted

4️⃣ Metric Computation

For each pipeline:

Contrast (std deviation)

PSNR / SSIM / MSE

Noise level

Gradient sharpness

Composite score (weighted)

5️⃣ Pipeline Ranking

All pipelines ranked

Best pipeline selected

Explanation generated:

Why it performed best

Trade-offs involved

6️⃣ RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

This is NOT diagnosis.

Metrics are summarized into a technical query

Query is embedded using BGE

Relevant PDF chunks retrieved from Supabase

Reranker selects top context
